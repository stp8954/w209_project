#### About:
While a dollar bill looks and feels the same all over the United States, its value is often very different depending on where it is spent. Nearly a decade after the 2008 recession and housing crash, much of the US has fully recovered. As a result, most of the country is experiencing rise in cost of living. But the rise is not consistent everywhere. The price of housing, food, and services vary considerably across the country. To shed light on these differences across every state we plan to analyze and visualize the trends in the cost of various entities that influence the overall cost of living.          

This visualization would be helpful to the general public, to see how their state compares to others in terms or expenses which should help them make more informed decision about relocating or negotiating salaries and healthcare benefits.
